[=============================================================================]How to use AreaFixThis RavelSHUFFLER's Plug-In makes it possible for you to connect anddisconnect echomail areas from this Mail Manager system. You don't needto install the program yourself. All you need to do is use it. One thingis neccesary: a password. You probably have already set this up; if notcontact me first, there is no way you can use AreaFix without a password!Apart from the password, you also need to know the name of my "AreaFix".AreaFix AreaMgr AreaManager will do.[=============================================================================]How to (dis)connect areas:Write a NETMAIL message to AreaFix. On the subjectline you put the passwordyou set up with this system.You can write some of following commands into message text. AreaFix willperform correspond operation.To connect an area you put the names of the echomail areas you want toconnect in the message text, (only 1 name on each line). Also you canput a '+' in front of the area name. To disconnect an area put a '-' in frontof the area name in the messagetext.[+]<areaname>            Connect an area.-<areaname>              Disconnect an area.%HELP                    Request this help text.%RESCAN                  All followed areas will be linked and rescanned%RESCAN <areaname>       Rescan area.%MAXMESSAGES <num>       Set rescan messages for last <num> messages in base.                         (default 0 - whole base)%MAXDAYS <num>           Set rescan messages for last <num> days in base.                         (default 14 days)%LIST                    Request a list of areas available to you.%QUERY                   Request a list of areas to which you are connected.%PASSWORD <new password> Change password[---]                    Everything below the tear line is ignoredThe first %RESCAN enables rescanning of the following areasand the next %RESCAN disables rescanning.[=============================================================================]Example:-------------------------------------------------------------------------From: Cyril Moorzin (2:5030/700.1)To  : AreaFix (2:5030/700)Subj: PASSWD-------------------------------------------------------------------------%HELP%LIST%QUERY+RU.MAC-SU.WINDOZE.MUST.DIE.95.TIMES%MAXDAYS 36%RESCANMACS.BUG.INFO-------------------------------------------------------------------------This message connects you to Area RU.MAC and MACS.BUG.INFO.
