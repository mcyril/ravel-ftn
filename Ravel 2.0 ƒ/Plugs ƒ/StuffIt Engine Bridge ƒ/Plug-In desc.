	Plug-In specification	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Name:			"StuffItEngineª Bridge"Qualified:		RavelSHUFFLER Plug-In extractorFunction:		Expander of ARCed, ZIPed, LZHed arcmailRequired:		StuffItEngineª v4.0 or better (4.5 for LZH)Configuration:	-Source code:	unavailableIMPORTANT! I occasionally learned aboutStuffItEngineª v4.5 features and implemented LZH and LHAexpander in this Plug-In. You should wait release ofSIEª 4.5 for exploring LZH. Only ARC and ZIP are workingwith older SIEª.Latest SIEª doesn't support the LZH extracting in this way.NOTE: Any of plug-ins can be removed from Plug-Insfolder for disabling their function(s). It's usefulfor non-standard extractors for FIDO (why you shouldinstall all plug-ins when you certainly know thatyour uplink/downlink compress arcmail with ZIP?).
