This directory is a trivial example of how to set up a new extension.Generally, Makefile.pre.in is the same for all extensions.  You editit only to point to the installed version of Python that you want touse.  Everything that's dependent on the particular extension is inthe file Setup -- which has the same format (and is processed by thesame script) as the Modules/Setup file in the main Pythondistribution.  Read that file (actually, Setup.in there) for detailedinstructions -- basically, you comment out lines for modules you don'twant and you edit the -I, -l and -L options and variable definitionsif necessary.Detailed build instructions are in Makefile.pre.in.
