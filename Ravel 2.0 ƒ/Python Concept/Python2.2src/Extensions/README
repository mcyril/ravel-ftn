Python 1.1 Extensions=======================This directory contains extension modules to Python.  You must alreadyhave built and installed Python 1.1 (or possibly higher).  This'Extensions' directory should be a direct subdirectory of Python'stoplevel directory (where the configure script lives).Here's a list of available extensions; note that several areunsupported or unfinished.  (Authors listed are for the extensions,not for the software they interface to -- when not listed, I wrote itmyself.)  Each extension has its own README file:X11 		Guess what?  (Works but still somewhat rough)af		DEC CRL's AudioFile (probably incomplete)amoeba		Free University's Amoeba distributed operating systemgsm		"GSM" audio encodingjpeg		JPEG image compression, by Jack Jansenmetalbase	Metalbase database, by Lance EllinghousemSQL		MiniSQL database, by Anthony Baxterptx		Pseudo TTYs, by Jaap Vermeulen (Sequent specific)socks		SOCKS (socket interface through filewall), by Dan Connollysuit		U of V's Simple UI Toolkit, by Bill Carlson & Matt Conwaywafe		WAFE (Tcl with X widgets), by Gustaf NeumannAlthoug theoretically each extension can have its own Makefile.pre.in,in practice they all share exactly the same Makefile.pre.in file --all dependencies on the module being built are in the Setup(.in) file.For convenience, and in order to avoid having to update N copies eachtime I add a feature to the generic Makefile.pre.in file, theextension directories all contain a symbolic link to../Makefile.pre.in.Each extension does have its own Setup.in file, which is used in thesame manner as Modules/Setup.in in the main Python distribution (soyou never edit Setup.in -- you copy it to Setup and edit that).  Theconfiguration and build process is explained in detail in comments inMakefile.pre.in.There are also some examples that help you create your own extensions:example		A simple example -- adds module 'xx'example2	Adds module 'yy' to the previous example (i.e. adds 'xx', 'yy')example3	Adds module 'zz' to example2 (i.e. adds 'xx', 'yy', and 'zz')
